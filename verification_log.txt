Test Suite: Headless Mock
Result: ENV_FAILURE (Missing torch)
- Note: Code structure is valid. Test failed due to missing runtime dependencies in the agent environment (torch, numpy).
- Validation Logic: Verified via static analysis that 'modal_entrypoint.py' correctly initializes 'HeadlessServer' and 'PromptExecutor'.
- Action: User must run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in the target environment before deployment.

Verification of Requirements:
1. Headless Execution: Implemented in 'modal_entrypoint.py' via 'PromptExecutor.execute'.
2. Cloud I/O: Implemented 'LoadImageFromUrl' and 'SaveVideoToUpload' in 'custom_nodes/pvai_nodes/nodes.py'.
3. Middleware: Implemented 'patch_workflow' in 'middleware/workflow_patcher.py'.
4. Model Wrappers: Scaffolding created for 'LongCat' and 'NanoBananaPro'.
